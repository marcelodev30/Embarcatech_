For security you **must** replace private.pem and privateaes.bin with your own keys, and ivsalt.bin with your own per-device salt. Make sure you **don't lose your keys and salts**, else you may not be able to update the code on your device.

Your signing key must be for the _secp256k1_ curve, in PEM format. You can create a .PEM file with:

```bash
openssl ecparam -name secp256k1 -genkey -out private.pem
```

The AES key is stored in a 32 byte binary file - you can create one with

```bash
dd if=/dev/urandom of=privateaes.bin bs=1 count=32
```

or in Powershell 7
```powershell
[byte[]] $(Get-SecureRandom -Maximum 256 -Count 32) | Set-Content privateaes.bin -AsByteStream
```

The IV salt is just a 16 byte binary file - you can create it the same way, replacing `32` with `16` and `privateaes.bin` with `ivsalt.bin` in the commands above.

You will need to program your OTP using the `otp.json` file generated by the build in your build folder
NOTE: This will enable secure boot on your device, so only correctly signed binaries can then run, and will also lock down the OTP pages the AES key and IV salt are stored in.
```bash
picotool otp load otp.json
```
